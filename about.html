            THE YALE SCHOOL OF ART IS A GRADUATE SCHOOL THAT CONFERS MASTER OF
            FINE ARTS DEGREES IN GRAPHIC DESIGN, PAINTING/PRINTMAKING,
            PHOTOGRAPHY, AND SCULPTURE
          </h2>
          <p>
            Artists and designers of unusual promise and strong motivation are
            provided an educational context in which they can explore the
            potential of their own talents in the midst of an intense critical
            dialogue. This dialogue is generated by their peers, by
            distinguished visitors, and by a faculty comprised of professional
            artists of acknowledged accomplishment. The graduate student’s
            primary educational experience at Yale is centered on the student’s
            own studio activity. Supporting this enterprise are the experience,
            knowledge, and skills gained from rigorous, structured courses such
            as drawing, filmmaking, the relativity of color, and the rich
            academic offerings found throughout Yale. Each student is routinely
            exposed to many aesthetic positions through encounters with faculty
            members and visitors. The School is devoted not only to the
            refinement of visual skills, but also to the cultivation of the
            mind. Students must bring creative force and imagination to their
            own development, for these qualities cannot be taught—they can only
            be stimulated and appreciated. The School of Art offers an
            undergraduate art major for students in Yale College (see the
            bulletin Yale College Programs of Study). In addition, the School’s
            courses are open to students in the Graduate School of Arts and
            Sciences and other professional schools of the University, and
            School of Art students may enroll in elective courses in the
            Graduate School and other professional schools as well as in the
            College with permission.

        <h2>Degree of Masters</h2>
        <p>
          The degree of Master of Fine Arts is the only degree offered by the
          School of Art. It is conferred by the University upon recommendation
          of the faculty after successful completion of all course work in
          residence and after a thesis presentation that has been approved by
          the faculty. It implies distinctive achievement on the part of
          students in studies in the professional area of their choice and
          demonstrated capacity for independent work. The minimum residence
          requirement is two years. All candidates’ work is reviewed by faculty
          at the end of each term. If the work is not considered satisfactory,
          the student may not be invited back to complete the program (see
          section on Review and Awards under Academic Regulations in the chapter
          General Information). All degree candidates are expected to be present
          at the Commencement exercises in May unless excused by the dean.
          Course work for the Master of Fine Arts degree carries a minimum of
          sixty credits. The disposition of these credits varies according to
          the area of study and is agreed upon at the time of registration
          between the student and the student’s faculty adviser.

        <h2>Public Lectures and Exhibitions</h2>
        <p>
          Each department has its own visitors program in which professionals
          from outside the School are invited to lecture to students or take
          part in critiques. The School also facilitates a public all-school
          lecture program, in which ideas of general and cross-disciplinary
          importance are explored by visiting artists and members of the faculty
          in events typically hosted in the evening that are free and open to
          the public. The School of Art’s galleries in Green Hall and EIK at 32
          Edgewood Avenue provide a year-round forum for the exhibition of work
          by students, faculty, and special guests in the four graduate
          departments of the School and the undergraduate program. Green Gallery
          is open to the public when exhibitions are scheduled, but open hours
          vary by semester. EIK is open during limited hours for specific
          exhibitions and events. Please refer to the Gallery & Publications
          page for more information.
