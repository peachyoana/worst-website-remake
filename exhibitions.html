        <p>
          The School of Art galleries in Green Hall provide a year-round forum
          for the exhibition of work by students, faculty, and special guests in
          the four graduate departments of the School and the undergraduate
          program. During exhibitions, Green Hall Gallery at 1156 Chapel Street
          is typically open to the public but due to COVID-19, it will remain
          open only to the School of Art and Yale communities until further
          notice.

        <h3>Vibrant Matters 2022 Painting/Printmaking Thesis Exhibition</h3>

          <em>“In looking at this book that I’m almost finished writing, I see
            here a mosaic pattern (Aztec-like) emerging, a weaving pattern, thin
            here, thick there. I see a preoccupation with the deep structure,
            the scaffolding. If I can get the bone structure right, then putting
            flesh on it proceeds without too many hitches. The problem is the
            bones do not often exist prior to the flesh, but are shaped after a
            vague and broad shadow of its form is discerned or uncovered during
            beginning, middle and final stages of the writing. Numerous overlays
            of paint, rough surfaces, smooth surfaces make me realize I am
            preoccupied with texture as well. Too, I see the barely contaminated
            color threatening to spill over the boundaries of the object it
            represents and into other “objects” and over the borders of the
            frame. I see a hybridization of metaphor, different species of ideas
            popping up here, popping up there, full of variations and seeming
            contradictions, though I believe in an ordered, structured universe
            where all phenomena are interrelated and imbued with spirit.“</em

            “I will shift from the language of epistemology to ontology, from a
            focus on an elusive recalcitrance hovering between immanence and
            transcendence (the absolute) to an active, earthy, not-quite-human
            capaciousness (vibrant matter).”

          Jane Bennett, Vibrant Matter, 2010

          The twenty-one artists in these two exhibitions are weavers. They are
          bricoleurs, they are collectors and storytellers, they are our new
          generation of historians, and they are painters of the
          impossible-to-describe thing that is the human psyche. My co-teacher,
          Rachelle Dang, began our year together by asking the artists—the Yale
          School of Art 2022 second-year Painting/Printmaking MFA students—to
          reflect on shared resonances seen in one another’s work. Together, we
          named embodied knowledge, interdependence, mending and healing,
          nonlinear time, layered and unreliable histories, tangled ecologies,
          and, above all, the reverberating power of the material world. Many
          artists in these exhibitions accumulate, layer, and dissect our
          material surroundings to reveal truths about human behaviors and our
          place in an ecosystem much larger than ourselves. Others trace single
          objects across space and time as a way to read and write anew personal
          and collective histories. All share overlapping commitments to many
          ambitious goals possible in painting and printmaking. They—
		  <br><br>
		 <ul>
			<li>
				trust the
				embodied reality of painting as sculpture, from pulverized healing
				crystals to woven food wrappers; from family photographs to
				second-hand clothing; from the brain’s pinpointed color receptors to
				the microscopic topography of a paint chip;
			</li> 
			<li>
				focus new frames on the
				past and present, through the lenses of architecture, archives,
				machines, and the mechanisms of the eye itself;
			</li> 
			<li>
				follow the historical
				construction of painting’s constituent parts, both substrate and
				pigment, including the muslin, calico, and poplin donated to a
				precocious college by Elihu Yale, then President of the British East
				India Company in Madras, India;
			</li>
			<li>
				pinpoint and destabilize symbols
				ranging from ancient Andean figuration to the colors red, white, and
				blue;
			</li>
			<li>
				express a collective, contingent, and tender self, searching for
				the body on the edges of perception;
			</li>
			<li>
				feel the haunting awe of the
				soil, the earth, and water, of being with animals, plants, and other
				creatures;
			</li>
			<li>
				embody our many inadequate histories in order to tell us
				new truths.
			</li>
		 </ul> 
		 </p>
		 <p>
		  Alongside all of this, these artists also create with
          joy—a true love of painting and printmaking, of research, and of
          storytelling. They delight in collected materials, recorded sounds, in
          a new image found. In sharing poems, music, and mending between
          friends. In writing shared stories and finding escapes from the
          confines of an exhibition setting.
		  <br><br>
		  This exhibition is a glimpse, a
          snapshot. It is an opportunity for each of us to see the expansive
          goals and brilliance of twenty-one artists at one moment in time and
          space. This is a thesis exhibition, a culmination of almost two years
          of work and profound personal and artistic challenges. It is also a
          nascent moment in the careers of artists I look forward to watching
          guide us into the coming decades of matter, meaning, and vibrancy.
          —Melanie Kress Thank you to my co-teacher Rachelle Dang, the second
          year MFA Painting/Printmaking students, and our collaborators across
