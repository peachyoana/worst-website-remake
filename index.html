        <p>
          The Yale School of Art is a graduate school that confers MFAs in
          Graphic Design, Painting/Printmaking, Photography, and Sculpture; and
          offers undergraduate-level art courses to Yale College students. Our
          website exists as an ongoing collaborative experiment in digital
          publishing and information sharing. It functions as a wiki—all members
          of the School of Art community have the ability to add new, and edit
          most existing content.

          FACULTY/ALUMNI: POST YOUR ART APPRENTICESHIP/INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES
          FOR UNDERGRADUATES The Yale Arts Apprenticeship Program is an
          initiative that connects Yale undergraduates, particularly those on
          financial aid, with professional arts practitioners of any discipline.
          As an option within Yale’s Summer Experience Award (SEA) funding
          model, the Arts Apprenticeship must fulfill the same basic
          requirements. Additional details, as well as those specific to the
          Arts Apprenticeship are included below. Yale faculty, alumni, or other
          arts practitioners interested in featuring positions through the
          program should contact Yale’s Creative Careers advisor. Which
          Opportunities are Eligible? Must be at least 30 hours/week, for at
          least 8-weeks over the summer months. Those 8-weeks do not have to be
          continuous if the mentoring Arts Practitioner agrees on a different
          schedule. The time commitment need not all be in direct contact with
          the Arts Practitioner. Independent projects, tasks, research, etc. can
          comprise much of the experience, as long as the Arts Practitioner is
          checking in regularly with the student to provide oversight and
          career-based context. The opportunity cannot be with a for-profit
          organization. The engagement for an Arts Apprenticeship should be
          directly with an individual Arts Practitioner and not with a company.
          The only exception to this would be if the company overseeing the
          apprenticeship were a registered non-profit organization. <br />For
